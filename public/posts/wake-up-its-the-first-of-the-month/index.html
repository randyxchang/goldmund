some observations

i rarely think i have things to write about, until i read what those i admire have written;
the dying legs of a stage of life (think end of school year, end of a trip) kill a lot of motivation;
use of emojis (writ large, realistically) but especially in a semi-professional setting isn&rsquo;t for me. i get it, but i can&rsquo;t do it;
capitalisation is good when writing, i&rsquo;ll give myself some leeway on listicle content;
awareness &amp; effort play a larger role in the value of something than i thought, and perhaps commitment is okay after all;
&ldquo;and so it goes&rdquo; has become a preferred term when writing, sorry for stealing it from Kurt Vonnegut;
And so it goes.

some changes

integrity, pro-social has revealed its importance to me, looks like the zoom wasn&rsquo;t really that needed;
forced reflection is underrated;
should probably fix my posture;
exercise is missed deeply;
external image became consuming for a bit;
small purchases/actions in line with the person — stupid? not viscerally obvious so far;
And so it goes.

some miscellany

only children and alone time (cred: Anjali);
segmenting home rest, physical rest, and the mental guard (cred: Kiki);
dumb off time, smart on time, and the circle (cred: Harsehaj);
perhaps paying more than your share isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing;
And so it goes.
