I have spent nearly two hours trying to find a reasonable flight to Anchorage. I was willing to fly from four different airports. The one reasonable flight (reasonable = wouldn&rsquo;t require me give up two&#43; days in Asia/cost below $3000 for a one way/require four total days of travel) was on a website called Ovigo. After filling out all my information, and clicking book, the website simply did not process a booking (I even called Amex to check).">

<p>I have spent nearly two hours trying to find a reasonable flight to Anchorage. I was willing to fly from four different airports. The one reasonable flight (reasonable = wouldn&rsquo;t require me give up two+ days in Asia/cost below $3000 for a one way/require four total days of travel) was on a website called Ovigo. After filling out all my information, and clicking book, the website simply did not process a booking (I even called Amex to check).</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to soak and move on. Time to write. I&rsquo;ve written down the list of posts I need to write here, and I&rsquo;ll strikethrough as I go:</p>
<ul>
<li>[[(blog) notes from my 30L backpack]]</li>
<li>[[foreign friends]]</li>
<li>[[DC.2]]</li>
<li>[[osaka, japan]]</li>
<li>[[tokyo, japan]]</li>
<li>[[kyoto, japan]]</li>
<li>[[seoul, south korea]]</li>
<li>[[houston, texas]]</li>
<li>[[san josé, costa rica]]</li>
<li>[[toronto, ontario, canada]]</li>
<li>[[A Wild Haruki Chase]]
<ul>
<li>11:55pm. Bang. First blog done. Cigar soon, maybe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>00:12
Back from a bit of a break. Have consumed 2000 mg of Vitamin C (am coming down with a cold). Also discovered where we keep the plum wine (my favourite drink). CBTM.</p>
<p>00:41</p>
<p>Pulled out the timer strat. In 27:10 I wrote [[foreign friends]], leaving out parts but more reflective than I thought. Happy with how it turned out. I wonder how I&rsquo;m going to fit in a cigar?</p>
