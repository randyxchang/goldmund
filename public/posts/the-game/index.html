<h4 id="some-observations">some observations</h4>
<ul>
<li>an oppressive Google Calendar liberates;</li>
<li>reading in setting adds something special;</li>
<li>actors very well might have too much creative control (sorry, Vin Diesel);</li>
<li>action movies may not have aged as well (sorry, Vin Diesel);</li>
<li>family — and familial level friendship — remains absolutely important (shoutout, Vin Diesel)</li>
<li>And so it goes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="some-changes">some changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>an oppressive Google Calendar (blame the visa);</li>
<li>a mistake with dates — and hopefully never again;</li>
<li>freedom;</li>
<li>expectations can be different from reality — not worse/better, just different;</li>
<li>And so it goes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="varia">varia</h4>
<ul>
<li>the chef of 100 Year Khao Soi;</li>
<li>familiar faces in a familiar place (hey, Hiroki!);</li>
<li>familiar faces in an unfamiliar place (RAYMOND);</li>
<li>verbose discussion;</li>
<li>And so it goes.</li>
