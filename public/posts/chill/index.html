<p>I spent &ldquo;fall break&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with Lawrence and Dua — two recurring characters — outside of Chapel Hill. My dorm became the occasional pit stop rather than a place to sleep; one advisor&rsquo;s home &amp; one friend&rsquo;s home hosted evening festivities; our adventures spanned Durham, Charlottesville, and Minecraft seed 8584926385964346659.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Over the afternoon coffees that seem to conclude every friend group meetup — putting a bow on four Cookout runs, two draft Instagram posts, and a round of TopGolf — we discussed our next destinations: considering Abu Dhabi, Taiwan, Japan, finalising with the painful realisation I was no longer nomadic, and that such travel is now both irresponsible and inconvenient.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>So far, on the weekends, I&rsquo;ve left Chapel Hill more than I&rsquo;ve stayed. I went to the beach, Atlanta, a lake house, the wilderness, D.C, and Charlottesville. I don&rsquo;t have any contrived reflections on this fact: I like new places, my friends are spontaneous, taking six different trips is better than six weekends of the same thing. And today, over afternoon coffee, I read a fantastic descriptor of what this &ldquo;same thing&rdquo; is. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> After all, the counterfactual to going out of Orange County is going out within Orange County, a cultural ritual that is deeply glorified, often overrated, extremely enjoyable. I&rsquo;ll leave the societal analysis of this to those better at it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote a long, somewhat angsty<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> piece reflecting on college so far.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>I certainly stand by it, but I decided against publishing it. The summary is that there is a lot of routine, similar to life, dissimilar to vagabondery.</p>
<p>On vagabondery: I left my passport in a girl&rsquo;s car&rsquo;s glove box &amp; her parents saw that since the 2023 issuance I had travelled to more than a dozen places &amp; collected a few dozen stamps &amp; they saw my Chinese visa &amp; they told her &amp; then she told our mutual friend &amp; then he told me about how he would give me my passport back &amp; I was reminded of how the itinerant wandering differed from my life now. After Dua &amp; Lawrence came &amp; I was torn away from this routine I realised that I loved the simplicity &amp; the comfortable healthiness &amp; having more than three sets of clothing.</p>
<p>&amp; I realised I did like being on the road (to Virginia &amp; back in a day) &amp; the happy middle is not a thing; that these two extremes require their own time &amp; cannot be experienced, really, simultaneously, at least in the true form.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Trips take, at a minimum, a day; after they pass, they expand to take more time. Routines take up weeks &amp; [[lisbon, portugal|shrink &amp; wither afterwards in the mind]]. Something funny about going out — in both senses — is that not much seems to happen in one hour &amp; a lot happens in the next. One sense of going out is something I will eventually grow out of, another sense is one that I suspect I will never grow out of; and both involve a group of friends that I hope never let go.</p>
<p>Here it was. There it is.</p>

<p>Having six months to kill allows you to stop in destinations along the way, implying the cost of the flight is lower. Excuse this mathematical fairy tale.
