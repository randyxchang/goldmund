      <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about four things lately. Here they are, and where I stand on them as of now (opinions that might change even a hour from now, let alone looking back in the further future). Published October 2nd, 2023.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is blogging arrogant? At its core, a personal blog is sharing writing about your own life for the consumption of others, or about sharing your own opinions on various subjects. Most blogs are also rife with little idiosyncrasies, design quirks, and writing styles that are simultaneously personal and meant to impress onto a reader more of your personality. These both require the natural assumption that your reader is interested — interested in your design quirks, in your opinions, in your life — which may be a trait that arrogance shares. I&rsquo;m not arguing all bloggers are egotistical. Though I do think if done incorrectly, this act of throwing writing out into the world can be <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — which is funny, because throwing writing out into the world can also be a deeply humbling experience.</li>
<li>On quality. I don&rsquo;t think my writing is <em>good</em>. Simple as that. I rarely edit before posting and I don&rsquo;t spend huge amounts of time planning. Instead, when I want to write out my thoughts on something, I write, and then I post. I wonder if I stop posting so much, and instead take time — time to digest an experience, a book, etc — I might produce better writing. The original philosophy of this website was almost about leaving an online record for myself down the line, but it might be arrogant (see above) to assume that non-edited, raw writing deserves to be public-facing.</li>
<li>This whole idea of &ldquo;beauty is terror&rdquo; has been echoing in my mind, because I keep recognising there are lots of aesthetically beautiful things around me, and I haven&rsquo;t read any other philosophical explanation of aesthetic beauty, meaning this theory of &ldquo;beauty is terror&rdquo; just keeps getting prompted whenever I see something pretty. I recently went to the cathedral light show in Reims, whose beauty absolutely shut my friend and I up (we are normally a very rambunctious duo; we never seem to stop speaking or laughing loudly, which I am sure is not aligned with French — or global — politesse). One could say we were awed into silence. Or terrorised. I suppose it&rsquo;s up to philosophy.</li>
<li>The future. I wrote, indirectly, some of my thoughts on this in the [[novelist as a vocation]] post. Basically, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how to live as much as possible (not in quantity of years, but in amount of novel experiences). One approach that a lot of the blog writers I like do, is to do cool things in some self-imposed, borderline ascetic manner. The most personal development I&rsquo;ve gotten (see [[the catcher in the rye]]) was also done in this manner, indirectly. I&rsquo;m not sure what my personal challenge will be — but keep you posted, yeah?</li>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think I am extremely arrogant, and the worst practitioner of this. It&rsquo;s no secret this blog has many design quirks, it features my writing style heavily, and is also just various narrations of my personal life. So maybe I&rsquo;m just reflecting. I still need to think more about this issue, I feel.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p><em>I took my first ever college midterm today, meaning I&rsquo;m halfway through the semester; meaning I&rsquo;m a quarter way through my first year; meaning I&rsquo;m 1/16th done with college. For those of you asking how it&rsquo;s going:</em></p>
<p>I often find myself thinking, more than anything else, &ldquo;<em>so this is it?</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From an etic perspective, I think I&rsquo;m doing well in college. I say hi to lots of different people, some people say hi back; I eat relatively healthy; I sleep enough; I attend office hours; I&rsquo;m doing well in my classes, which are largely small and generally interesting. I keep in touch with old friends, call my parents at regular intervals, walk often, look at morning sunlight, drink enough water, and keep up a supplement regime. I work out five times a week, I run at a slightly lesser frequency. I&rsquo;ve largely avoided the weed-outs, the gen-eds, and the freshman traps. I joined clubs I was interested in, all of which are novel activities. I practice my languages consistently and hang out with Chinese people occasionally. My room is clean, comfortable, and decorated. I still don&rsquo;t know what I want to study, but I like not knowing. I don&rsquo;t procrastinate as badly as I did in high school.</p>

      <p>At a scholarship &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> weekend, I anticipated the most boring event would be the small-group panel with two alums. I say this because the alums in my room were, to me at the time, fairly cookie cutter — successful, upper-middle class millennials. Our earlier guest speaker was a Rhodes Scholar/former aspiring astronaut/Silk Road biker, for context.</p>
<p>The event went basically as I expected. The boxed lunch was also not very good. The speakers were kind, offered good insight into college, and really likeable. To me at the time, though, I assumed there was no way these people were &ldquo;considered&rdquo; — how could someone <em>seriously</em> reflect and question and still end up in a similar, conventional place? — and so, as an iconoclastic, angsty, existentially confused high school senior, I felt somewhat turned off by the whole thing.</p>

      <p>I once spent a summer at home trying to get out of the house as much as possible. Conversation after conversation later, the mundane began to wear. No one was fast, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>And so, for a little while, I prided myself on speed in the literal sense. I&rsquo;d predict where conversations were going and head them off. You watch a few patterns, here and there, and it sometimes didn&rsquo;t even matter if the other person was going to say the thing that you said for them, because people beforehand had completed the sentence the same way. The curse, of course, being that each conversation began to bleed further and further. Contexts were merged; stories were conflated. Fast became more about speed than style, and rewards were found in quantity than quality.</p>
