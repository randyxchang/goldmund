I always thought February had 24 days. Not usually a big deal; quite relevant when planning travel. An extra week in Chiang Mai won&rsquo;t kill me, but it does have some visa implications I need to sort — something I&rsquo;m putting off by writing this.
some observations

the little changes are sometimes all you need: lattes to espressos, drake to novo amor, a little laugh once in a while;
backlit anything, concrete, wood, plants in some combination;
vibes, energy, and the human experience are equally legit to authority;
the meditation retreat probably — probably — changed my life;
scheduling that flows feels better than what life is now — a lot of dead time (perhaps this is a benefit of advance planning);
coffee, tea, wine, fine dining, menswear, cigars, running shoes, watches, brandy, whisky, cologne, when did the beautifully complication of every niche begin, why do these little communities always exist?
And so it goes.

some changes

i never thought i&rsquo;d buy a barbour jacket, i now own one;
aesthetic continues to consume;
is solitude a blessing? a life skill? a harmful habit?
integrity, pro-social is definitely confirmed — sometimes selfish, sometimes not, but definitely confirmed;
Bryan Johnson;
words have fallen a bit out of fashion — attribute it to sleep, meditation, lack of suitability, Thailand&rsquo;s culinary scene, who knows;
And so it goes.

varia

the thai teen who wanted to listen to kendrick lamar;
the amount of French presence;
hostel &amp; backpacker culture continues to be a bit too hot; this life of solitude continues to be a bit too cold; Bangkok was probably the right amount but hard to replicate;
And so it goes.
