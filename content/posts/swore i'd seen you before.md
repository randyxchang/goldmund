*or, march*

I always thought February had 24 days. Not usually a big deal; quite relevant when planning travel. An extra week in Chiang Mai won't kill me, but it does have some visa implications I need to sort — something I'm putting off by writing this.

#### some observations
- the little changes are sometimes all you need: lattes to espressos, drake to novo amor, a little laugh once in a while;
- backlit anything, concrete, wood, plants in some combination;
- vibes, energy, and the human experience are equally legit to authority;
- the meditation retreat probably — probably — changed my life;
- scheduling that flows feels better than what life is now — a lot of dead time (perhaps this is a benefit of advance planning);
- coffee, tea, wine, fine dining, menswear, cigars, running shoes, watches, brandy, whisky, cologne, when did the beautifully complication of every niche begin, why do these little communities always exist?
- And so it goes.

#### some changes
- i never thought i'd buy a barbour jacket, i now own one;
- aesthetic continues to consume;
- is solitude a blessing? a life skill? a harmful habit?
- integrity, pro-social is definitely confirmed — sometimes selfish, sometimes not, but definitely confirmed;
- Bryan Johnson;
- words have fallen a bit out of fashion — attribute it to sleep, meditation, lack of suitability, Thailand's culinary scene, who knows;
- And so it goes.

#### varia
- the thai teen who wanted to listen to kendrick lamar;
- the amount of French presence;
- hostel & backpacker culture continues to be a bit too hot; this life of solitude continues to be a bit too cold; Bangkok was probably the right amount but hard to replicate;
- And so it goes.
