At a scholarship "discovery"[^1] weekend, I anticipated the most boring event would be the small-group panel with two alums. I say this because the alums in my room were, to me at the time, fairly cookie cutter — successful, upper-middle class millennials. Our earlier guest speaker was a Rhodes Scholar/former aspiring astronaut/Silk Road biker, for context. 

The event went basically as I expected. The boxed lunch was also not very good. The speakers were kind, offered good insight into college, and really likeable. To me at the time, though, I assumed there was no way these people were "considered" — how could someone *seriously* reflect and question and still end up in a similar, conventional place? — and so, as an iconoclastic, angsty, existentially confused high school senior, I felt somewhat turned off by the whole thing.

I spoke to one of the panelists afterwards about being Asian American at UNC. What I really wanted to ask about was the phenomenon of Asian Americans being seen as unfit for management roles (bamboo ceiling).
