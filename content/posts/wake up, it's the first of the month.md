*or, february*
#### some observations
- i rarely think i have things to write about, until i read what those i admire have written;
- the dying legs of a stage of life (think end of school year, end of a trip) kill a lot of motivation;
- use of emojis (writ large, realistically) but especially in a semi-professional setting isn't for me. i get it, but i can't do it;
- capitalisation is good when writing, i'll give myself some leeway on listicle content;
- awareness & effort play a larger role in the value of something than i thought, and perhaps commitment is okay after all;
- "and so it goes" has become a preferred term when writing, sorry for stealing it from Kurt Vonnegut;
- And so it goes.

#### some changes
- integrity, pro-social has revealed its importance to me, looks like the zoom wasn't really that needed;
- forced reflection is underrated;
- should probably fix my posture;
- exercise is missed deeply;
- external image became consuming for a bit;
- small purchases/actions in line with the person â€” stupid? not viscerally obvious so far;
- And so it goes.

#### some miscellany
- only children and alone time (cred: Anjali);
- segmenting home rest, physical rest, and the mental guard (cred: Kiki);
- dumb off time, smart on time, and the circle (cred: Harsehaj);
- perhaps paying more than your share isn't such a bad thing;
- And so it goes.
