I have spent nearly two hours trying to find a reasonable flight to Anchorage. I was willing to fly from four different airports. The one reasonable flight (reasonable = wouldn't require me give up two+ days in Asia/cost below $3000 for a one way/require four total days of travel) was on a website called Ovigo. After filling out all my information, and clicking book, the website simply did not process a booking (I even called Amex to check). 

I think it's time to soak and move on. Time to write. I've written down the list of posts I need to write here, and I'll strikethrough as I go:

- [[(blog) notes from my 30L backpack]]
- [[foreign friends]]
- [[DC.2]]
- [[osaka, japan]]
- [[tokyo, japan]]
- [[kyoto, japan]]
- [[seoul, south korea]]
- [[houston, texas]]
- [[san jos√©, costa rica]]
- [[toronto, ontario, canada]]
- [[A Wild Haruki Chase]]
	- 11:55pm. Bang. First blog done. Cigar soon, maybe.

Back from a bit of a break. Have consumed 2000 mg of Vitamin C (am coming down with a cold). Also discovered where we keep the plum wine (my favourite drink). CBTM.

Pulled out the timer strat. In 27:10 I wrote [[foreign friends]], leaving out parts but more reflective than I thought. Happy with how it turned out. I wonder how I'm going to fit in a cigar?
