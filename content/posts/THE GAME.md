*ah, hello, April*

I was once in a car when I asked "how would you guys define clean to someone with no life experience"; to which someone responded "not dirty"; at which point I launched the argument "well what is dirty?"; silence & then "you need to get back to school" responded.

How does one define irresponsibility? Silliness? The line between the two? What is unhinged? 

This blog, probably. This (section of the) blog probably lacks a certain level of grounding needed for lucidity. 

Welcome to the show.

#### some observations
- an oppressive Google Calendar liberates;
- reading in setting adds something special;
- actors very well might have too much creative control (sorry, Vin Diesel);
- action movies may not have aged as well (sorry, Vin Diesel);
- family — and familial level friendship — remains absolutely important (shoutout, Vin Diesel)
- And so it goes.

#### some changes
- an oppressive Google Calendar (blame the visa);
- a mistake with dates — and hopefully never again;
- freedom;
- expectations can be different from reality — not worse/better, just different;
- And so it goes.
#### varia
- the chef of 100 Year Khao Soi;
- familiar faces in a familiar place (hey, Hiroki!);
- familiar faces in an unfamiliar place (RAYMOND);
- verbose discussion;
- And so it goes.
