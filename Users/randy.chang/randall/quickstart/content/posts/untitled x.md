This website's [1/about](/1/about) section says that "Most of my free time is spent reading (fiction) or writing (this blog)."

This is, on some level, a lie. I'm not actually sure what preoccupies most of my time. For people around my age, this is usually excusable with "school". But (1) I'm on summer break and (2) I'm the first to admit school does not take up that much of my time.

New model! Maybe something (like, [writing/cleveland|ahem, this](writing/cleveland%7Cahem,%20this)) might not take up a lot of time, but a lot of mental space.

This is interesting. But probably not an excuse. The time is still present in the day. So where does it go?
