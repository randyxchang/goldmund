I wrote in [travel/reims/reims.writing](/travel/reims/reims.writing) about how I enjoy reading others' blogs. For the blogroll that I love & have carefully selected:

What's your favourite story? (will accept stories that happen to other people that you know; will accept a fictional story if I won't be disappointed that it's fictional; will also accept a media form of any kind). My favourite story (as of now) is Oladele's, from [travel/DC/DC.1|washington, dc](travel/DC/DC.1%7Cwashington,%20dc). A close second is the story about [travel/dar/coffee and Kilimanjaro|Kilimanjaro](travel/dar/coffee%20and%20Kilimanjaro%7CKilimanjaro) I heard in Dar es Salaam.
