*A range of whimsical things I'd like to do, ranked in how valuable they would be (financially, emotionally, and otherwise).*

1. Fight <u>one</u> amateur fight, and lose badly.\[^1]
2. Finally speak a second language.
3. Become a monk (for at least some time).\[^2]
4. Learn to think in USD. They are not worth the same as CAD.
5. Ride the Ha Giang loop and not die while doing so.
6. Learn Farenheit. Also, learn how to spell Farenheit. Fahrenheit. Got it. Sorry.
7. Learn to cook.
8. Skydive!
9. Learn cardistry (I once was able to; Sean reminded me in Dublin how much I'd forgotten)
10. Do that thing where you can roll a coin across your knuckles.
11. Learn Ms. Evans' pen trick that combines the thumbaround and the reverse.
12. Learn to bartend; learn to be a barista

\[^1]: The quantity of this hypothetical battle (i.e its nonrepetitive nature) is equally important to its outcome (i.e a horrible loss). The format is not relevant.
