*the short*\
I'm a Canadian Morehead-Cain scholar at UNC-Chapel Hill.  You can subscribe to an email "newsletter" \[^1] on [Substack](https://rxyc.substack.com/), where I promise to send updates on this blog completely erratically. When people ask me what my major is, I answer that I'm "going with the flow". I'm now Americanised enough for non-Americans to think I'm American, but not enough to convince anyone else. My email is randy.chang@unc.edu, which one should use liberally, and ideally erratically.

*the medium*\
Most of my free time is spent reading (fiction) or writing (this blog). My academic courses this year included a guest-lecture series on Israel/Palestine, a guest-lecture heavy class on diplomacy and Beowulf, a premed health writing class, an internship recording the oral history of Southern union labour organisers, basic quantificational logic, Greco-Roman athletics, and weightlifting.

Recently, I've spent more time stalking other people's blogs (see [1/blogroll](/1/blogroll)) and brushing with quantitative reasoning after [ASPR](https://www.aspr.camp/). I now maintain this blog because I like what writing does to me, and also so that the external viewer (you!) can see what I like thinking about in case you ever want to reach out (which you should totally do, please.)

*the long*\
I started writing this blog during [1/travel logs|my year abroad](1/travel%20logs%7Cmy%20year%20abroad) (which is a pretentious phrase that disguises how I lived out of a 30L backpack). I logged my travels with — similar to all other written things I produce — too many em dashes, commas, and bracket asides. I spent my gap year [1/travel logs|travelling Europe and Asia](1/travel%20logs%7Ctravelling%20Europe%20and%20Asia), [1/books pt.1|reading a book a week](1/books%20pt.1%7Creading%20a%20book%20a%20week), nearly dying at the summit of [travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro](/travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro), spending time with family, and meeting some extremely inspirational people that I continue to look up to (and shamelessly copy).

Growing up, I cycled through three different suburbs in Ontario before moving to Toronto to attend the boys-only private school I eventually graduated from. Somewhere in between, I debated for the national team (some indirect thoughts [travel/travel/amsterdam & berlin|here](travel/travel/amsterdam%20&%20berlin%7Chere) and [writing/slow; fast|here](writing/slow;%20fast%7Chere)), assisted on research into Ghanian graveyards, and did some student government stuff. I also learned how to tie a tie three different ways, did an educational biking trip through Belgian/French WWI battlefields, and befriended some incredibly uplifting, supportive, and energetic people.

More miscellany: I'm right-handed in every task except brushing my teeth. I'm currently in an ongoing struggle to learn how to read poetry (and how to let poetry affect me). The trait I admire the most is adaptability; the trait that irritates me the most is deliberate close-mindedness. My favourite author is Christopher Buckley; favourite film is *The Hustler*; favourite artist is a tie between Laufey & NIKI; favourite book is *Lucky Jim*, by Kingsley Amis; and my favourite reader is you, no question.

\[^1]: This implies I often have enough news to put in a letter, which is not true.
