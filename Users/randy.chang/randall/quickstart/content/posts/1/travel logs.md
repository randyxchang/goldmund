I came home for the first time in a while late August. Thus marked the beginning of a year without school. I moved around quite a bit, and I've tried to produce something that corresponds with each place. Places I've spent longer in have subposts associated with them.

There's no real way to read these logs. Chronologically tracks my thinking; geographically could be more interesting. *Prelude* is the time I spent before going abroad; *Odds* is the time abroad, alone; *Friends* is closer to the holidays, when my parents joined me for parts; *While You Were Sleeping* is when I left my parents to move more eastward, putting me in a timezone opposite to most of my close friends/family. *Heads Up, Homecoming* is when I spontaneously decided to come home (and surprise my parents), stopping at various spots in the Americas along the way. 216 days abroad; 333 days without a long stay at home.

My writing here is more narrow than punctilious. Many parts I've left out. A stranger in a kitchen once told me his year abroad was the highest highs and the lowest lows he's ever experienced. I wait to see if that holds true for my case as well.
