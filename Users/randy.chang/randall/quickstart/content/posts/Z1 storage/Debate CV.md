Currently [a full-ride](https://www.moreheadcain.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill. I was also accepted to Stanford, Dartmouth, Duke, and won over \$1million in merit scholarship. Over four years of debate, I won every major Canadian university tournament (including the largest online tournament in history), Ontario provincials, Canadian nationals, Harvard World Schools, and the World Championships as a four-year member of Team Canada. Individually, I was also ranked as the youngest-ever best speaker at Harvard, when I was 14.

### Coaching

* I have taught 110+ students across four years of coaching. My students include the current Canadian national champion, both current Ontario provincial champions, and the current Harvard champions. I currently coach the French National Team, which was recognised as the nation with the most progress at the recent World Championships.
* In high school, I created a nonprofit that taught a self-designed introductory curriculum to public speaking and debate, which scaled to four countries. I also met with members of Toronto's municipal government to plan an outreach expansion into in-person classes for low-income areas.
