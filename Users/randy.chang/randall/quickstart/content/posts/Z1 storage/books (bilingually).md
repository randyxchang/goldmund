I read a lot at certain times, at other times I read almost never. Over the next year (i.e from August 27th, 2023 to August 27th, 2024) I'd like to read 52 books.

However, the idea of doing "a book a week" has never felt logical to me â€” if one week, I want to read a lot, and another week, I get bitten by a snake, I probably will not read the same amount. Even if some weeks I read a different amount, by the end, I hope that I will have finished 52 books, equating to "a book a week".

I'd also like half of them to be in French. My level in French reading comprehension, as of now, is best described as "slightly-below-average kindergartener". Allons-y!
