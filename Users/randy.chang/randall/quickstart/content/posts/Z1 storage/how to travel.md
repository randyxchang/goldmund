*(creative ways to optimise, as a Canadian.\[^1] Highlights are tips that I rarely see mentioned elsewhere.)*

1. Your credit card should not have foreign transaction fees, as these add up with volume. Scotiabank's Passport line avoids this. See point 5 for further details on getting cash.

2. **Airlines cannot count a duty free bag in luggage restrictions. Buy something small — or just a shopping bag! — from duty-free and put your overweight things in it. Put a jacket or something on top if you want. This has worked for every low cost carrier I've taken**.

3. **Multi-port GaN chargers are more compact, quicker at charging your devices, and quite cheap. Many have their own built-in international attachments so you don’t have to lug around a huge adapter. I got one from Minix on Amazon the night before leaving. Get a 100W one for maximum charging speed.**

4. A reliable, quick way to figure out how best to go from the airport to the city is to google “X airport to city reddit”, and read how actual locals get to the city.

5. Many regions have useful apps that a quick google can reveal. For instance, Bolt in Europe (cheaper Uber), 123go in Thailand (travelling in between islands), Grab in Southeast Asia (cheaper Uber).

6. For Canadians, the equivalent to the Charles Schwab debit card\[^1] (i.e the best way to get cash abroad) is to use a combination of the Wealthsimple Cash card and the Wise card. Withdrawing with Wealthsimple will give you the Mastercard standard rate without fees, from a Canadian debit account you can fund with e-transfer. In some countries — notably Tanzania — Wealthsimple doesn’t work, in which case you can use a Wise card to withdraw \$350 CAD monthly without fees. Wealthsimple has no ATM fees or limits.

   NB: Any other formal way of getting cash (e.g. exchanging) loses more money, with the exception of Norbert's gambit. The informal way is to get a "Google" rate by swapping currency with a relative/friend. Obviously comparatively limited.

7. If you like to read, bring an e-reader. A Kobo (Canadian Kindle) accepts .epub and .pdf, which is easier if you pirate books (Anna's Archive; zlib). Some recent Kindles accept these formats, but not all.

8. Whether you learn the local language or not, smiling helps a lot in interactions. 

9. **Cellular data is obviously important as you’ll rely on your phone a lot. Esims are convenient, but economically unoptimal. If possible, getting a local plan (in a country with cheap telecoms) with good roaming policies is much less hassle if you're visiting many places (on my French plan, for 20 Euro/month, I had fast, unlimited data in all of Europe, lots of Asia, and the US).** 

10. An easy way to make friends abroad is to find the local community of some hobby/activity you are already comfortable with, and ideally has a strong community culture around it. Some common ones are gym culture, pickup games of soccer/basketball/volleyball, etc — but it could also be anything!

11. (Personal take): try to cut down on the amount of stuff you have to lug around so you can save time in the airport and customs. For instance, your phone can be a camera, maybe all your devices will take the same kind of cable. There is a whole online community around "onebagging" — I recommend the 30L ULA Dragonfly, which I can personally attest is bombproof.

12. Have a battery pack for your phone. Anker seems to be great for weight/power ratio.

\[^1]: Americans have some advantages/disadvantages. For instance, the Charles Schwab debit card; for instance, getting profiled as geographically illiterate.
