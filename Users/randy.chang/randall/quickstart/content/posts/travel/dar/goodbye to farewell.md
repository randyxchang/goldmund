Something that surprised me is how well-practiced saying goodbye has become. When I was a kid, I saw most of my friends the next Monday, at the latest. Nowadays, in this little nomadic life, I see the people I love on brief trips or visits, a purgatory of texting, social media, and the occasional video chat filling up the time in between.

I said bye ten times in Tanzania. Ten hugs, nine "see you in Chapel Hill", one "see you in Brodhead". The things we saw in the distance had now passed, and one Bolt arrived after another. I'm the last one left, counting down the minutes, for nothing feels too pressing enough to do when my flight is in two hours. The little banter between cafe regulars, the constant stream of *karibu*, it was enough to make me forget we were only visiting â€” and I suppose this is goodbye as well, both to that feeling and all the things that caused it. Onto Asia.

Chapel Hill plays Duke today, which means millions will invariably be overjoyed and millions will invariably be devastated in the state of North Carolina. I never thought I would feel attachment to this rivalry; life is funny I suppose.
