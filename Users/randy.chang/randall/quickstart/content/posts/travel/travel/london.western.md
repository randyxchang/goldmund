While this trip was not caused by my confusing London, Ontario with London, England, it would have been very funny if it was.

Shoutout to the Costco kiosk for having tape and scissors; don't put a car in park when it's still moving; open the notes app frequently during the night. To everyone I saw, I miss you already & all the best.

I also saw T-Pain perform. I miss you too, T-Pain.
