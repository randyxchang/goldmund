Two sayings constantly ring in my head—one given, one generated. I constantly remind myself "things will work out", and if (when) that doesn't prove true, I tell myself "all you need is faith that things will eventually work out".

This attitude might explain the following problem I had preceding my move to France: I just did not organise my travel well. Even though I had weeks of spare time, I barely finished the paperwork that I needed to fund my year abroad on time. I hadn't locked in my travel logistics until a week before my trip. I hadn't figured out what to pack until the night before.

(To anyone from the foundation—if you ever read this—I am very sorry).

Another thing I've had to come with grips with is that, even though I feel nothing but anxiety (probably travel/my future-related; see above attitude of blind faith), on the surface, this gap year just sounds irresponsibly fun from a third party view. Little do they know just how literal the label of "irresponsible" is.

Anyway, here is some quick, pretty uninteresting B-roll about how I'm finding Paris (I did end up surviving and finding a place to sleep):

* I got an empty row on my plane. Biggest W in many, many, many years.
* To get a cell plan, I used a kiosk with a friend of mine. Then the kiosk asked for an IBAN, which neither the US/Canada use. An employee had asked us to make sure we had an IBAN before starting the kiosk, and I had blustered "yes" so now neither of us could admit we didn't actually have an IBAN. Finally, after looking very confused for a few minutes, we asked what to do, and the employee, with an extreme air of kindness, clicked the "skip this step" button at the bottom.
* I landed at 2pm, slept at 2am, woke up at 2pm the next day. I did not eat anything but a croissant and an espresso until 6pm. I'm not sure if this is good or bad for jet lag, but I have a feeling it's either extremely optimal or the worst possible thing I could have done.
* My current manners are such a menace to French politisse. I think I've offended all French people I've spoken to. I'm sorry, French people.
* Everyone has been really nice, in spite of above point. Thank you, French people.
* They have Chipotle here!
* This morning — afternoon — I literally had no idea what I was going to do, see, or eat. I kind of just hopped on the subway and found myself at the Arc, poorly-dressed in comparison to everyone else. I have now successfully ordered a croissant and an espresso in French though. Small wins.
