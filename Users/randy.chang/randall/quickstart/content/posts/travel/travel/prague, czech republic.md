I stayed back in the apartment to do a quick check in (learned some friends had just got home, some were planning to leave again; heart was fuller). Extreme indolence and resulting guilt suddenly washed over me after finishing. Thankfully, nearly the second after they began feeding off each other, my mom called, giving me the address to a classical concert she said "we could see if we were interested".

I arrived early, turns out we didn't have tickets. I called mom, who instructed me to "talk to them" (meaning we, in fact, were not certain we could see it if we were interested). I talked, we ended up getting in, and we descended under the sprawling Prague Castle to a holiday concert.

It's ambiguous whether I'm a classical music person. It's unambiguous my writing ability does not extend to do justice to the concert we saw. From what I understood: the concert was kind of a "bangers only" type of thing; the cellist must have selected some of the pieces because he was having an absurd amount of fun; the audience was evenly split between "has never been to the symphony before" and "extremely prolific symphony-goers". Spending time with Dua (mimicry has taught me roughly 85% of my manners; mimicry of Dua about 65%) meant I knew the basics of how to behave, at least enough to not offend the older people sitting around me. Good night, better than indolence.
