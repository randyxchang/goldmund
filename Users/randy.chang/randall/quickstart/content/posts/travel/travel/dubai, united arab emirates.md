Some cities have certain things in the air. Sometimes this is literal (pollution); the fun times arise when this is figurative. Dubai is a city that chomps at the bit. The size of the mall, the Burj Khalifa, the other attractions are all dwarfed by the size of the city's ambition. We walked for what felt like days — at the very least, a period much longer than the time we spent deciding to go to Dubai — and still, there was the distinct feeling that the city wouldn't reveal itself, that when we returned the city would be even more unrecognisable.
