The half day began with renting a car as a pair of legal adults not yet 21 (which only took asking about sixteen different places, a search that began with phone calls in Houston and ended with phone calls on the concerningly cheap Spirit flight). It ended with a long drive —  in said car — down a long stretch of dark highway, during which we discussed almost entirely one topic.

Many of my thoughts remain similar to the ones in [travel/travel/dublin, ireland](/travel/travel/dublin,%20ireland) — experiences, reasons to keep going, etc — with one addendum, that being the sheer absurdity of how much we saw without any idea where to go or what to do. A WhatsApp number and a dodgy recommendation from a car salesman replaced our trip research. We ended up hanging out with a coffee farmer (where I ate the best tomato of my life), hiking a few waterfalls, ziplining with some ex-Canadian Floridians, and seeing sloths. Perhaps most pertinently, Dua invented a new language I refer to as Google Spanish, where he would translate what he wanted to say then read the Spanish portion aloud —  popular with the many kind grandmothers who ran the bakery we stopped at; absurdly popular with one taxi driver who didn't find any reason to doubt our long pauses or inability to understand any questions.
