One of my favourite features of the English language is how close antonyms often are — for instance, calamity & calm. Often, the line between the two is equally impervious as their phonetic relationship — tranquility changes to turmoil as easily as four letters are dropped from calamity. At least, so far.

The original plan today was to go up two different mountains. We get up the first mountain and see nothing (winds, weather, etc). Switzerland has a nifty system where you can check a webcam to see the view on top of most mountains. As we were ushered to begin our journey down by cable car (the winds were getting worse) I frantically scrolled through webcams, realising the compression of Switzerland — previously something we heralded as a travel convenience — meant cloudy weather spared few victims. We took the train to a town called Zug. We wandered around the old town, and went home afterwards.

This day was less eventful than others. Clear weather turned cloudy; views that could have been compared to the Matterhorn that awed each of us ceased to exist in this temporary reality. Still, with hours of travel time, my parents and I talked at length — talked about nothing, admittedly — and that produced a fairly enjoyable day. Calm, in a sea of calamity.
