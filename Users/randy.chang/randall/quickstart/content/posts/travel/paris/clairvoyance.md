And they will feel demotivated to love other people. And thus sets in the vicious cycle; like a virus, sadness will spread — uncontrollable like a wildfire. Thus proving that the world is connected. And everyone is an important cog in the grand machine that is the cosmos.
  * *Lance*
* one day I'm going to marry **REDACTED**.[^1] Every day, every night will be sweet as sugar, I will drink — I will sip — slowly from the fountain of our love, as it trickles softly on my never aging flesh, because our love keeps me immortal.
  * *Dane*
* also, I'm an **REDACTED** guy, not a **REDACTED** guy. Actually, I do feel — I do love both; I love a good **REDACTED**
  * *Also Dane*
* With the departure of the merry three, France will be missing thr
  * *Lance*
