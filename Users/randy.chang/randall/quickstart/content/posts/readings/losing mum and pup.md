1. "Pup" as a title for William F. Buckley, who also has held titles such as "Father of American Conservatism", makes the book so much better. I know this may be unfaithful to author intentions, but I couldn't help but recall the foremost mental association of the word pup I hold (something like [this](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=589889819\&sxsrf=AM9HkKkoCeyuBzPYj2-Ez2qG5HwQW45c_Q:1702333023829\&q=cute+puppy\&tbm=isch\&source=lnms\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwj1ubLZtIiDAxWAg_0HHdEqA7AQ0pQJegQICxAB\&biw=1542\&bih=941\&dpr=1.6)) when imagining a figure who has probably represented something like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=scary+grown+up+dog+but+scary+in+an+intellectual+way+\&tbm=isch\&ved=2ahUKEwjst8mEtYiDAxWZ6QIHHSsSAxUQ2-cCegQIABAA\&oq=scary+grown+up+dog+but+scary+in+an+intellectual+way+\&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1DaB1iNWWDzYGgCcAB4AIABnwGIAbEckgEEMzguNJgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB\&sclient=img\&ei=uop3ZezyFpnTi-gPq6SMqAE\&bih=941\&biw=1542) historically.
2. Reading my favourite author's reflections on both his parents dying while being on vacation with both my parents (they are still intact for now, in case you were concerned) has certainly inspired some reflection. I'm more grateful for the time we're spending together, etc, etc. But it's also caused me to think a bit about how I was raised & my background. Part of me has some innate interest in the other side, the old-school and the other; the larger part is more than content with what I was blessed with.
3. I've never noticed how much Christopher Buckley influences my own writing (maybe even, subconsciously, my college application choices — a scary thought) until I started reading him again. Nothing I produce can match the acerbic, scintillating, and charming writing that he produces — but fighting for a little glimmer has definitely provided a lot of joy over the years.
4. Kissinger died while I was reading his biography, and I was suddenly confronted by the possibility Christopher Buckley's work will come to an end one day as well. Unlike the possibility my work will come to an end, please know the universal reaction (if I am the universe) will be one of despair, Mr. Buckley.
