Part of being in Tanzania required us to take a long bus, which I am currently still on (15 straight hours and counting). I read *Siddhartha* on this ride, completely engrossed, so much so that it was hard to read anything else afterwards.

I have lots – *lots* — I'd like to say, but I'll be at a Buddhist meditation retreat in a few weeks\[^1] and this unexpectedly fitting pre-reading may be best discussed afterwards.

One thing I do want to say now: [readings/slaughterhouse five|Slaughterhouse Five](readings/slaughterhouse%20five%7CSlaughterhouse%20Five) discusses time with properties similar to the river. I think the fact that a sci-fi antiwar novel holds similarities with Siddhartha is quite beautiful, and also a fact both novels' viewpoints would approve greatly of.

\[^1]: Yeah, I know. Long story, one I'll tell on the other side of it.
