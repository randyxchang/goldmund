Sachi (fellow Morehead/planner of [travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro](/travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro)/witness to events on [travel/tanzania/a day on killy](/travel/tanzania/a%20day%20on%20killy)/overall living legend) graced Toronto with her overall living legendary presence about a week ago, and this collection of essays she found in Japan came along with her.

Ironically, my gap year worlds — the city of one friend group, a member of the other; and serendipitously later in the evening, several high school friends — colliding was quite thematically fitted to the spirit of Murakami (at least, as it's laid out in these works).\[^1]

\~

I wrote a while ago, in [Murakami.pdf](Murakami.pdf), that most people had a different take on what aspect of Murakami's writings were interesting. The overarching take of this collection was that Murakami bridged the ephemeral with actuality. I associate assorted memories with physical places:\[^2] surrounded by totems that anchor drifting memories otherwise intangible. We attempt to connect different realities — historical, geographical, etc. — with universal, scientific rules. And our dreams are eventually reflected onto reality, just as reality guards our memories.

So, in a revision to my previous thought within the pdf, perhaps the real reason Murakami remains appealing is that he helps reveal order, rationalisation to the chaotic world — and he does so with controlled chaos. Or this is just an intellectual wild Haruki chase.

Phenomenal essays, thanks again Sachi.

\[^1]: Savar once sent me a quote after reading my work for the first time — something along the lines of "em dashes, commas, and bracket asides are best used sparingly, for they create breaks in rhythm that ultimately detract from clarity". I'm sorry to whoever generated this idea, and I'm doubly sorry for you, poor reader, for this Frankenstein's monster of a sentence paragraph.\
