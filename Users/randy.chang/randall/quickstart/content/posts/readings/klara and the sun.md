Of all the things I've read — and heard — about this book, I enjoyed the perspective that this book is Ishiguro's reflection on being a parent. Part of that may be living at home and my close relationship with my parents, but it's nice to encounter a story about the perpetual feeling of indebtedness one feels to their parents; how that may be a natural of way of things rather than some injustice to correct.
