On Friday, I received this book at TRU\[^1], avoiding work; somewhat subconsciously, I finished it at TRU on Sunday morning, continuing to avoid work.

An 8-bit Shakespearean tragedy is easy to portray as demagoguery. I promise it'll subvert those expectations at every turn — in a manner that is surprising and occasionally Chekhovian. And so it went.

\[^1]: By the way, you can order just an avocado for 25 cents. I am inordinately proud of this hack and wish to claim it — if forced to choose — as my sole Carolina legacy. If TRU ever patches this, I will transfer schools. 9/29/2024.

*PS For a while, I couldn't reliably spell tomorrow. I just did it 2/3 times for the title of this post. Progress I attribute to finally attaining higher education.*
