Usually, the more I read someone's writing, the more I like them. Bourdain gained & lost & gained my pre-existing admiration over the course of this book â€” and I think he knew that might happen, and I think he was comfortable with that. This might not make him a better commercial author but certainly makes him a better person, which is why I end this book similarly to most books: a place of admiration. It had a similar effect on my view of fine dining and the general culinary trade, although maybe this admiration will have to be from afar (as I am fairly confident I could never work in a kitchen).
