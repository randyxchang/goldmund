Some narrative about this well-written nonfiction book (the SECOND of this list; two more than I usually read in a year):

This book was dormant for about a year (travel, etc). In honour of coming up on a year since Morehead-Cain Discovery weekend (where I got the book), I decided to finish the book, front to back, where I first learned about the Morehead, a cafe about a five minute cycle or — because my bike is currently broken — a twenty minute walk from my house.

Much of the book concerned likability. For most of my reading time, a woman spoke Spanish on an important business call behind me (important, judging by her unwavering intensity). Another person in front of me kept vaping, which due to the grace of local Toronto zephyrs, provided cloud cover for my literature.

These people were initially not very likeable, in my limited point of view. I then made some conversation. They were, in fact, quite likeable.

A concluding narrative:

I recently\[^1] started listening to the band Vampire Weekend. Walking back from the cafe, the first song I hit play on was a Vampire Weekend song. The conversations I was coming from combined with the catchy bridge, and I walked with a little more enthusiasm, which naturally led me to think more about this cool band I knew nothing about. Perhaps the second this thought came to my mind, a guy walked by wearing a Vampire Weekend t-shirt. We made some more conversation — he explained they were a "bunch of preppy New York guys" who he loved, then subsequently he would beam with uncontrollable delight anytime we mentioned one of their songs  — turns out, he's seeing them in Toronto this September. Enjoy, Parker. I also thought you were very likeable.
