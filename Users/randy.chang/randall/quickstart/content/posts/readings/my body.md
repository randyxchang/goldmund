Primary highlight was "Buying Myself Back"; "Transactions" slightly trailing. I'm not sure if I have a particular thought, but I'll always enjoy thinking about the book and its wider place. Interestingly — though not the first one I've read this year — the first non fiction book listed here. By Emily Ratajkowski, no less.
