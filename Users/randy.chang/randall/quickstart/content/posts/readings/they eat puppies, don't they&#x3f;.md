If you thought this title was bizarre or incongruous, that is probably what led you clicking on this particular post, and that likely reflects you're not sure who Christopher Buckley is, for his other works that I've read include titles such as:

* God Is My Broker: A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7½ Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth
* Thank You for Smoking
* Boomsday
* But Enough About You

And if the Wikipedia description of this book was shocking\[^1] don't fret! The other books involve, in order: a stockbroker's journey to commercialise a monastery, written in self-help pastiche; a lobbyist perpetually engaged in a verbal dance defending the health impacts of smoking; a book narrating the life of a policy proposal to mandate the euthanization of anyone above 70; a collection of essays.\[^2]

I'm fairly certain that Christopher Buckley is my favourite author. Once, I asked my English teacher if he had read anything by Christopher Buckley, to which he responded "oh, William Buckley's son?" which was odd, because I had always thought of William Buckley as Christopher Buckley's dad. This should qualify what I'd like it to qualify, but it also may just reflect more of my lack of taste or historical culture.

Anyway — I enjoyed the book. In order to not potentially anger the political players I may want to work for someday, I will leave it at that.

\[^1]: "In an attempt to gain congressional approval for a top-secret weapons system, Washington lobbyist "Bird" McIntyre teams up with sexy, outspoken neocon Angel Templeton to pit the American public against the Chinese. When Bird fails to uncover an authentic reason to slander the nation, he and Angel put the Washington media machine to work, spreading a rumor that the Chinese secret service is working to assassinate the Dalai Lama"\
\[^2]: The essays are really funny as well!
