Full disclosure: I read this book last year, when I was working through the enjoyable-but-bizarre pursuit of reading one author's entire body of work (in this case, Murakami).\[^1] However, I've found myself saying it was my favourite Murakami, and then my favourite novel, thus meaning I've recommended it on more than one occasion, thus meaning I felt guilty for not remembering it well. And so, in one night and one afternoon, I re-read *South of the Border, West of the Sun*.

This is not a book of extremes. It's not the most beautiful prose; it doesn't show the most important lessons; it's not the most popular or well-known. Rather, the book combines a moderate amount of nearly everything — Murakami element,\[^2] philosophical discussion, love conflict, beautifully descriptive prose — creating something satisfying yet simple. If I was in the same situation, my goodness, I would have no idea what to do.

In some ways, this work feels *human*, and that's what cements it in my mind.

\[^1]: I've tried to replicate the state of mind since by trying the same with Orwell, Christopher Buckley, and Kurt Vonnegut. Haven't come close.\
\[^2]: A non exhaustive list: ambiguous ending, jazz, classical music, ears, records, a bar, supernatural woman, and so on.
