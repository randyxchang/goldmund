I've been in London for a few days now, and I kept trying to think of something to say on this book (similar to thought processes in [travel/NY/NYC](/travel/NY/NYC)). Here are some things that came to mind:

1. Two facts about Orwell make this book pretty interesting (taken from Wikipedia—the most trustworthy of sources, I believe): (A) "'it was written simply as an exercise and I oughtn't to have published it, but I was desperate for money'" ("It is Orwell's most formally experimental novel, featuring a chapter written entirely in dramatic form, but he was never satisfied with it and he left instructions that after his death it was not to be reprinted");  (B) Orwell lived through similar conditions to Dorothy leading up to the novel — he went hop picking, he lived in a small town, he had familial relations to the clergy and friends who had familial relations to the clergy, etc. Live the actual life, write a loosely fictional novel. Is that research? Is that inspiration?
2. I think I'll read Ulysses next.
