1. This book could be an outfit accessory. I'm not that performative, I promise!
2. A collection of things people have said to me about this book:
   * *Yeah, I had to read it for Russian literature class. I'm not sure why you're reading it for fun.*
   * *Will you like it? I don't know. Do you like pain?*
   * *The best book of all time.*\
     And my personal favourite:
   - *The crime happened, and then I was like, where's the punishment??*
