casio watch sometimes works and sometimes doesn't

imagine if we just wrote at length about one niche thing or person or topic

*the (lack of) value of professionalism*

My college has many student organisations. Some are dedicated to "unserious"\[^1] things — board games, Love Island, live enactments of Battleship. Others are dedicated to "serious"\[^1] organisations — often measured by how proximate they are to the prestigious\[^1] business school.

I joined a few "serious" organisations, all of which communicate an implicit promise of helping you get into this business school (via weirdly selective processes and lots of hierarchy). Hierarchy probably has value. It mirrors lots of the organisations that aforementioned organisations are meant to prepare you for.

\[^1]: This label is dumb. But we use dumb words all the time and roughly understand their meaning. Sorry for the reductiveness.

Life now is different

* gap year: material pleasures, some spiritual
* college: intellectual pleasures, less material
* ASPR:
* israel: spiritual and intellectual pleasures
