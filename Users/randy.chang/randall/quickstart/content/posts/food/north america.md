Jose's coffee farm\
*san jose, costa rica*

If you call a WhatsApp number, Jose will direct you to his brother, also named Jose, and this second Jose will show you around his "coffee farm" â€” which actually farms almost every crop you could imagine. You can ask him virtually any question about complex intricacies of each crop's process. Don't miss the "coffee jelly" (made from the often neglected bean shells) that accompanies the dark/medium/light coffee tasting. Also notable: focus on sustainability, natural processes, and farming off historical knowledge (Jose's four children are already being instructed).
