*on the inferiority of Western asian masculinity, interior chinatown, and the souls of yellow folk*

I recently read Interior Chinatown.\[^1] In ten days, the series will premiere on Hulu, starring two of the ~dozen Asian actors that white people know (Ronny Chieng, Jimmy O. Yang). This book reminded me — and while I haven't spoken about them much, or written about them — I'm increasingly aware I have fairly extreme views on race — about being Asian. These are views I've subconsciously held for a while & explicated as I grew older; and I'm fairly confident they may change — but I am willing to accept the risk of my future self cringing at these past thoughts to formally type them out now.

A necessary disclaimer: I use "Asian" unfairly reductively to describe East Asian, and realistically, usually Chinese, because that's what I am; and I'm generally talking about a dynamic of growing up in the West, because I imagine this is not as much of a dynamic when growing up in, like, Shenzhen. Also, I'm mainly talking about masculinity, as how Asian women feel is something less formed in my mind.

\~

My views are probably the worst kept secret in the world. I've joked about not "liking" white people; I've only seriously considered dating Asians. I've established entire friendships — at least from my purview — on a primary foundation of mutual understanding.

I know Asian race consciousness sounds silly, and probably quite novel, for most Asians; and certainly for most non-Asians. Dig a little deeper — as I curiously did intermittently in high school — and a subterranean world reveals itself, ranging from angry subreddits to books and YouTube channels. At times, the discourse feels password-protected, as people whose features are similar to mine make references that possess magnitude only evident to other people with similar features. At times, it's humourous to see the Fung Bros talk about plastic-wrap on the TV; at times, you only chuckle when Harold gets assigned work by his colleagues on Friday evening; at times you're a little scared when you don't feel immediate disgust at some disgruntled Asian Redditor's diatribe about being ignored by those around him.

Han from Fast & Furious is one of the coolest Asian characters to exist in media. There's fan theory-verging-on-canon that he was the continuation of one of the  characters in one of the original works considering Western Asian masculinity — *Better Luck Tomorrow* — and for a lot of Asian kids growing up, he was the fictional daydream. Easy smile, wealthy rebel, sufficiently charming to attract Wonder Woman (non-Asian). The crew recruits Han to play the role of "chameleon" in their heist — someone who can fit in anywhere.

In a word, this sums up both the blessing and the curse that growing up Asian-American, Asian-Canadian actually is. We're able to fit in anywhere, run with any group. There's Asian skaters, Asian weebs, Asian frat guys, whatever you want. This is similar to any race, obviously. Maybe Asians can do it to a larger extent (there's enough of us such that an Asian person isn't too incongruous in any country; stereotypes that Asians can't do certain academic disciplines aren't as limiting/popular as other races'; etc.) but I don't think the phenomenon is accounted for by this. I think the problem is, we don't *dominate* any of those identities. It's still a little funny, a little incongruous whenever an Asian is within any group — they're maybe not your first picture, but maybe your second or third if really prompted — like a tatted Asian rapping\[^2] or a Korean guy wearing a Sigma Nu shirt.\[^3]

I can think of two notable counterexamples. One is any discipline related to math — but even then, a white nerdy guy is a totally congruous picture — and one is CS — but Indian, white, both work.

What I'm trying to express is that there's few, if any, societal disciplines/identities/groups where Asians are the primary, dominant group; one test for this being whether one can picture any other ethnicity being the forefront; or a more pertinent test, whether it seems a little funny, a little incongruous that an Asian is doing it.

The relevance of this is double-edged. It means we can do anything, really — startups, corporate settings, crime. It's this property that makes Han the choice for "chameleon" — the property that allowed me to move from country to country and get smiles.

However, it also makes Asians somewhat invisible. Perhaps this is a contrived link — I am confident the phenomenon exists, irrespective of whether this explanation holds — but if you can always expect one Asian professor, one Asian cook, one Asian basketball player (and not the majority to be Asian, because we aren't the *primary* group, just a possible one) your eyes glaze right over, like background extras in a movie. Here is where I think the masculinity element is partially factored in: it's no secret Asian women are fetishised; almond eyes and slender arms and thin, straight bodies seen as an exotic femininity. These similar traits on Asian men — generally, that Asian people, men no exception, don't confine as well to Western beauty standards — render Asian men as less desirable, women as objects of extraordinary (i.e non-normal) desire.

These two factors — invisibility & never being the "primary" group — lends itself to the better-documented "inferiority" that Asians often identify (and the discussion of which was my personal highlight of Chinatown Interior). Success wasn't enough to overcome the inferiority. Nor is the historical discrimination Asian Westerners faced — immigration quotas, back-breaking labour, racist attacks, legal segregation — sufficient to have this modern inferiority recognised.\[^4] it wasn't the "primary" injustice/discrimination we think of (slavery).\[^5] Just like not belonging to any group, Asian Western history doesn't belong to either extremity.

Here is where I disagree with where I first learned to articulate these beliefs — The Souls of Yellow Folk, the various subreddits, the Wong Fu productions — it's victimising, narcissistic, and flat out wrong to act like Asian men are the only  group with societal invisibility/inferiority: which Chinatown Interior correctly calls out. Old people, women, the overweight, etc.

I think, on some level, I've been insulated from the excesses of this dynamic. I'm tall, more muscular than most Asian men.

\[^4]: Not that this inferiority is caused by historical factors, but that society often recognises historical injustice as a strong motivator to rectify any current inequalities, at least more than complex social dynamics/perceptions of groups. Redlining seems more intuitively awful — and easier to rectify — than not being rented to informally.\
\[^5]: Nothing *wrong* with this ordering to be clear. Slavery was inhumanly awful.
