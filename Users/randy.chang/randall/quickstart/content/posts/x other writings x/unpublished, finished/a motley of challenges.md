Back at the start of my gap year, in October, I wrote a now-archived post recording various things I had been thinking about. Within it, I wrote the following:

> I've been thinking a lot about how to live as much as possible (not in quantity of years, but in amount of novel experiences). One approach that a lot of the blog writers I like do, is to do cool things in some self-imposed, borderline ascetic manner. The most personal development I've gotten (see [readings/the catcher in the rye](/readings/the%20catcher%20in%20the%20rye)) was also done in this manner, indirectly. I'm not sure what my personal challenge will be â€” but keep you posted, yeah?

From then until now, here are the "challenges" that come to mind:

* Climbing [travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro](/travel/tanzania/kilimanjaro)
* Completing [travel/bangkok/meditation|ten days as a monk](travel/bangkok/meditation%7Cten%20days%20as%20a%20monk)
*
