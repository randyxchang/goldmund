I met a teacher when I was 17. He spoke quietly. Dressed well, but not the kind that catches your attention; the kind that requires multiple glances before you understand the canvas as it comes together. I answered his questions a few times & each time I was wrong & each subsequent time I figured there was no way I could be wrong & I'd be wrong again until he stopped calling on me and I stopped raising my hand, although I'm not sure which one of those events came first in my mind.

I asked him what he would read if he could only read one medium for the rest of his life, what he would prefer. He answered poetry.

I thought poetry was rhyming couplets set together, rendering it watered-down prose meant to fit in a musical format. I thought all poems wanted to be prose when they grew up â€” and that good prose would always better express
