*there you are, May*

Before embarking on my gap year, I decided, without any particular reason, I had to only carry one backpack. Most in my situation choose to pair one large 50L backpack with a smaller 10-15L daypack — I recklessly decided I would find a bag that could do both. I've now lived out of the same 30L backpack for a year. It's been to four continents, travelling from the top of Kilimanjaro soaked in rain to the inside of an adorable labrador's mouth in Turkey.

The bag is sturdy, but it's also surprisingly capacious: clothing, toiletries, my hopes & dreams. The only problem is that it couldn't fit anything suitable to write on. As such, this blog was born as a Siamese twin to the year.

I'm writing this on May 16th, 2024, where 19 years ago I was born. On this day, I've finally reached the age of majority in the place I've called home for most of my life. The same time last year, I checked off legal adult, and age of majority in most places around the world that I would call home temporarily up until now.

One bizarre phenomenon that underwrote this year were how the smallest things would carry so much. Prima facie, the maximum a day lasts is 24 hours — many of my days were much shorter, due to a love for sleep — and still each would contain so many events, up & downs multiplied by the lack of routine. Similar patterns would follow other areas: I had less in common with others but more to talk about; I had less linguistic capability but more mutual understanding; and I kept in touch with few people but rarely felt alone. Also, I had a tiny backpack and never really felt constrained. Having less choice over my possessions sometimes freed me to focus on decisions that really mattered — like where to go & more importantly what to eat.\[^1]

## Some interesting numbers:
