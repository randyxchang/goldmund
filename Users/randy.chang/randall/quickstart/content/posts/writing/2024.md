I possess what I think I can call "reasonable impatience." I read really fast, mainly because I have a habit of skipping description.\[^1]

This is a symptom of a larger problem, which I will call the optimisation issue.

\[^1]: I know roughly what a home looks like — chairs, tables, walls, roof — and knowing that the ottoman is beige and historically significant doesn't add meaningfully to understanding that the antique dealer character probably has good taste in furniture. Again, forgive the snarky, dramatic turn of phrase.
