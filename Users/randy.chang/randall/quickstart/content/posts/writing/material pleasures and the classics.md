One of my English teachers — although I guess we call them professors now — is a bearded, whipsmart, older man. He is, in both physical appearance and mental sharpness, comparable to the other two fantastic English teachers I've had: one that taught me for seven hundred days, the other for seven.\[^1] I write this as I am simultaneously meant to be writing a "COVID narrative" for his class.

One of my favourite quotes I've ever heard is from one extremely wealthy guy I know giving advice to a newly minted wealthy guy.

\[^1]: I *still* have not forgiven Honours Carolina for making me drop this seminar.
