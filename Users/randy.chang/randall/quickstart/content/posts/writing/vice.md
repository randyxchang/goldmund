wine

song

coffee

* peaberry espresso in Dar — strong then dissipates super quick. no real hints of anything
* peaberry espresso at Akha Ahma — doesn't dissipate in the same way
* chiang mai catimor at Roast8ry — outrageously good. the first time i've picked up the hints of something at the end of the espresso. sweet. dissipates even BETTER than peaberry. merlot note lasts the longest, sweetness of the fruit nearer to the end of the espresso.
