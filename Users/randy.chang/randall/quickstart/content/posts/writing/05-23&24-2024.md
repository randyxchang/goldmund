I have spent nearly two hours trying to find a reasonable flight to Anchorage. I was willing to fly from four different airports. The one reasonable flight (reasonable = wouldn't require me give up two+ days in Asia/cost below \$3000 for a one way/require four total days of travel) was on a website called Ovigo. After filling out all my information, and clicking book, the website simply did not process a booking (I even called Amex to check).

I think it's time to soak and move on. Time to write. I've written down the list of posts I need to write here, and I'll strikethrough as I go:

* [(blog) notes from my 30L backpack](/\(blog\)%20notes%20from%20my%2030L%20backpack)
* [travel/CM/foreign friends](/travel/CM/foreign%20friends)
* [travel/DC/DC.2](/travel/DC/DC.2)

* [readings/a wild haruki chase](/readings/a%20wild%20haruki%20chase)
  * 11:55pm. Bang. First blog done. Cigar soon, maybe.

Back from a bit of a break. Have consumed 2000 mg of Vitamin C (am coming down with a cold). Also discovered where we keep the plum wine (my favourite drink). CBTM.

Pulled out the timer strat. In 27:10 I wrote [travel/CM/foreign friends](/travel/CM/foreign%20friends), leaving out parts but more reflective than I thought. Happy with how it turned out. I wonder how I'm going to fit in a cigar?
