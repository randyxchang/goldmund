*what I wish I wrote in HNRS89*

It's an early morning, and I can't help but think of all the various slices of life that  this liminal time of day-night, that my stripped bed, that whatever else flits into awareness recall. I remember that my backpack was half-zipped on my first day — perhaps because of how eager I was; perhaps because of how nervous I was — and that I slept on a stripped bed during orientation. I remember very little about the weeks, but I remember some about the days.

I always thought college would be easier to write about. I probably live a life that's one-two standard deviations different from the average UNC student; and so you'd think that would make it even easier. And yet, I have little to say. Here goes.

I'm slowly developing this model — referenced implicitly in other parts of this website — that there's this rare, beautiful thing that happens when you look up, and realise a community feels different for some reason, in a way that makes you smile. This energy is tangible, at times physically palpable. I feel lucky to have experienced concentrated doses of these in [travel/travel/2.2|Taiwan](travel/travel/2.2%7CTaiwan), in a classroom, in conversation.

I don't like writing about high school: I've changed a lot (I hope so), it had its flaws, I want to deny the reality I probably peaked in senior year.

One of my good friends took his life in October of my senior year. I was online for the rush, for trying to find him. I'd never dealt with death before. I don't think I helped much. I remember I was surprised at the level of my mother's concern — she told me to stop studying — when I told her what happened.\[^1] My best friend was much closer to him. He kept calling me. Breathlessly, he told me what happened on the first call. I dreaded each time my phone buzzed afterwards. I slept fitfully, unsure what would happen in the hospital purgatory.

I texted him in the middle of the day, figuring that it'd be nice to see when he woke up. I can't remember fully, but I think that was following a schoolwide assembly to tell everyone he was severely injured. Then, before math —the only class my best friend and I shared, when we were supposed to chat in person — we were called into another assembly. I was wearing a grey v-neck sweater.

\[^1]: Obviously ridiculous that I was surprised, in retrospect.
